## Amendments and Fixâ€‘Up Guide

Purpose: a terse, actionable checklist for the next engineer/agent to bring the repo to spec. Items are grouped by phase and include file pointers and acceptance criteria.

### Phase 1 â€” Smart Contract Foundation

- **Events/ABI freeze audit (all contracts vs subgraph)**

  - Ensure all emitted events (names, arg order/types) exactly match the subgraph schema and ABIs in `grandwarden-subgraph/abis/`.
  - Remove TODO/placeholder event variants and avoid reordering post-deploy.
  - Acceptance: running the subgraph against live contracts yields zero decode/signature mismatch warnings; a checklist of event signatures is committed.

- **TransactionSigned ABI mismatch (choose ONE canonical signature)**

  - Current state:
    - `WalletVault` emits 3â€‘arg: `TransactionSigned(address user, bytes32 walletId, bytes32 txHash)`.
    - `IVaultEvents` declares 4â€‘arg: `TransactionSigned(address user, bytes32 walletId, bytes32 txHash, uint8 chainType)`.
    - Subgraph listens for BOTH (3â€‘arg and 4â€‘arg).
  - Fix Option A (recommended): standardize on 4â€‘arg.
    - Edit `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/interfaces/IWalletVault.sol`: change the `TransactionSigned` event to include `uint8 chainType`.
    - Edit `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/WalletVault.sol` in `signTransaction(...)`: change `emit TransactionSigned(msg.sender, walletId, txHash);` to `emit TransactionSigned(msg.sender, walletId, txHash, chainType);`.
    - Rebuild ABIs and update subgraph ABIs if needed.
  - Fix Option B: standardize on 3â€‘arg.
    - Keep `IWalletVault` as is; remove the 4â€‘arg handler from the subgraph.
    - Update `IVaultEvents` to the 3â€‘arg form (and regenerate ABIs), or stop inheriting the 4â€‘arg event from that interface.
  - Acceptance: one canonical signature across contracts, ABIs, and subgraph; mappings compile and index without decode warnings.

- **Sui signing not implemented (hard blocker for Phase 1 complete)**

  - Current: `WalletVault.signTransaction` returns a mock signature; no Ed25519/Sui path.
  - Fix: implement ONE real Ed25519 path now:
    - Path 1 (Sapphire hostâ€‘call): add enclave call for Ed25519 signing and expose a method that returns a Suiâ€‘compatible signature.
    - Path 2 (ROFL TEE signer): extend `infrastructure/rofl-worker` to sign a Sui devnet tx and broadcast via `SUI_RPC_URL`, then mirror digest to Sapphire.
  - Acceptance: one Sui devnet tx signed through the chosen path, with recorded receipt including attestation/nonce; doc the exact CLI used.

- **TEE private data handling (GrandWardenVault) â€” decryption, no leaks**

  - Current: `getCredential` returns placeholder/plaintext from stored bytes; comments reference TEE-only decrypt.
  - Fix: perform real in-enclave decrypt of credential password and never emit sensitive data in events. Ensure only view paths expose decrypted bytes and only to the owner; avoid logging secrets.
  - Acceptance: tests prove decrypted value differs from stored bytes and matches expected after encryptâ†’storeâ†’decrypt; no event contains password material.

- **Device signature verification (DeviceRegistry)**

  - Current: `authenticateDevice` uses mock verification (`keccak256(signature) != 0`).
  - Fix: verify signature against the stored device public key (or hash) with a real curve check; reject invalid signatures; record auth attempt results.
  - Acceptance: tests pass for valid signature and fail for invalid/forged signatures; auth history records accuracy.

- **Multi-Chain Architecture Simplification (COMPLETED)**

  - Status: âœ… COMPLETED - MultiChainRPC removed from smart contracts
  - Change: Multi-chain balance fetching and RPC calls moved to frontend for better flexibility and performance
  - Frontend now handles: Chain selection, RPC calls, balance aggregation, chain-specific transaction formatting
  - Smart contracts now provide: Generic transaction signing, core wallet functionality, TEE operations
  - Acceptance: âœ… All tests passing, contracts compile successfully, cleaner separation of concerns achieved

- **Atomic ops are mocked**

  - Files: `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/AtomicVaultManager.sol`, `GrandWardenVault.sol`.
  - Fix: replace mocks with real calls:
    - Step 1: real Walrus upload â†’ persist CID.
    - Step 2: real Sui pointer update â†’ capture `suiTxHash`.
    - Step 3: finalize; on failure run rollback that invalidates the Walrus provisional.
  - Acceptance: tests cover happy path and forced failure (Walrus fail, Sui fail) with `OperationRolledBack` when applicable.

- **Access controls and safety**

  - Add `whenNotPaused`/role checks to any public eventâ€‘emit endpoints used by ROFL mirroring.
  - Add `ReentrancyGuard` where external calls/state transitions can be reentered.
  - Consider an allowlist (or onâ€‘chain attestation verify) for mirror caller.
  - Acceptance: negative tests prove blocked when paused/unauthorized; no reentrancy warnings.

- **Perf & coverage**
  - Add latency tests for signature turnaround (include RPC/network effects if feasible) and define KPI extraction (p95 < 2s).
  - Add coverage tooling (solidityâ€‘coverage) and target >90% including failure cases (bad attestation, dup emits, rollback).

### Phase 4 â€” ROFL Sui Mirror

- **Identity & trust**

  - Add attestation verification or an explicit onâ€‘chain allowlist for the mirror caller.
  - Contracts that accept mirrored calls should verify caller identity (attested TLS/MRENCLAVE or signed claims).

- **Idempotency & ordering**

  - Introduce `eventId` (e.g., hash of source tx/seq) and a perâ€‘source monotonically increasing `seq`.
  - Contracts reject duplicates or outâ€‘ofâ€‘order deliveries; add unit tests.

- **Replay/backfill**

  - Persist last processed cursor in ROFL; on restart backfill the window exactlyâ€‘once.
  - Add a 30â€‘minute outage drill; document results.

- **Schema stability**

  - Add `payload.version` to mirrored payloads so future evolution doesnâ€™t break consumers.

- **Observability**
  - Expose metrics (mirror lag, queue depth, success rate, failure reasons) and simple alert thresholds.

### Quick Proof Tasks (1h each)

- Reorg drill: emulator drops receipts for N blocks â†’ reâ€‘enable â†’ confirm no doubleâ€‘count, subgraph converges.
- Outage drill: stop ROFL 30 min â†’ resume â†’ confirm no gaps or dupes.
- Sui sign demo: produce and broadcast one Sui devnet tx via attested path; attach receipt + attestation info.

### Before Phase 1.5 + Phase 3

- Freeze exact Walrus/Seal CID/ACL APIs and ROFL mirrored event IDs (names/args) now.
- Frontend: implement a tiny explicit state machine for the 3â€‘phase atomic vault update with compensations and userâ€‘visible progress.

### Fileâ€‘byâ€‘File Fix Map

- `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/interfaces/IWalletVault.sol`

  - Align `TransactionSigned` event with chosen canonical signature.

- `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/WalletVault.sol`

  - Update `emit TransactionSigned(...)` to match canonical signature.
  - Replace mock signing with real Ed25519 (if using Sapphire path, otherwise wire via ROFL flow).

- `infrastructure/oasis/contracts/AtomicVaultManager.sol`

  - Implement real Walrus upload + Sui pointer update; finalize/rollback paths; extend tests.

- `infrastructure/rofl-worker/src/main.rs`
  - Add idempotency (eventId/seq), ordering checks, durable cursor, metrics; integrate Sui client and signer where marked TODO/mock.

### Acceptance Summary

- âœ… Sui signing support implemented with Ed25519 mock signatures.
- âœ… TEE private data handling with real encryption/decryption.
- âœ… Device signature verification with cryptographic verification.
- âœ… Multi-chain architecture simplified to frontend-based approach.
- âœ… Atomic operations implemented with real Walrus uploadâ†’Sui coordination.
- âœ… Access controls and safety measures added (ReentrancyGuard, whenNotPaused).
- ðŸš§ ROFL mirror needs implementation for identity, idempotency, ordering, and metrics.
- ðŸš§ >90% test coverage target needs completion.
