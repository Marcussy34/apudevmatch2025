# üîí Grand Warden ‚Äì Product Requirements Document (v4)

_Last updated: 25 Jul 2025 ‚Äì v4: Wallet Vault + **Sui Event Mirroring via Sapphire (ROFL)**_

---

## 1 ¬∑ Executive Summary

**Grand Warden** is a privacy-first security suite delivered as a browser extension (with PWA fallback). It bundles two core pillars under one UX:

1. **Password Vault** ‚Äì Cloud-synced, zero-knowledge credential manager
2. **Wallet Vault** ‚Äì Always-encrypted storage & enclave-based signing for Web3 keys

A mandatory third pillar is a **live, cross-chain data layer powered by The Graph**. This layer indexes all relevant security events via a **GraphQL endpoint**, used by the client for UI state, notifications, and analytics.

> **Note:** Since The Graph cannot index Sui natively, we use an **Oasis ROFL off-chain worker** to mirror Sui events to Sapphire, where synthetic events are emitted and indexed.

---

### Core Infrastructure

- **Sui** ‚Äì Public state (Move objects, device registry, CID pointers)
- **Oasis Sapphire** ‚Äì Confidential compute & remote-attested key custody
- **Oasis ROFL** ‚Äì Trusted off-chain worker that mirrors Sui events into Sapphire
- **Walrus + Seal** ‚Äì Decentralized blob storage & ACL
- **Sui zkLogin** ‚Äì Seed-phrase-free onboarding (Google/Apple identity)
- **The Graph** ‚Äì Self-hosted node with custom Sapphire emulator for real-time indexing

#### Updated Event & Mirroring Model

- Sui emits canonical public events (no secrets) that include `eventId` and per-source `seq` for ordering:

  - `DeviceRegistered(user, deviceId, deviceName, publicKey, registeredAt, eventId, seq)`
  - `DeviceStatusChanged(user, deviceId, newStatus, changedAt, reason?, eventId, seq)`
  - `VaultPointerCreated(user, vaultId, walrusCid, metadataHash, createdAt, eventId, seq)`
  - `VaultPointerSet(user, vaultId, walrusCid, metadataHash, stage, updatedAt, eventId, seq)` where `stage ‚àà {Provisional|Finalized|RolledBack}`
  - `BlobACLUpdated(user, blobId, policy, authorizedDevices[], updatedAt, eventId, seq)`
  - `RecoveryInitiated/Approved/Completed(..., eventId, seq)`

- ROFL Worker:

  - Computes/validates `eventId`, enforces exactly-once and monotonic `seq`.
  - Maintains durable cursor/replay; exposes metrics (lag, queue depth, success rate).
  - Calls Sapphire with attested identity or allowlisted key.

- Sapphire (MirrorInbox):

  - `mirrorEvent(user, eventType, payload, eventId, seq, attestation)` or typed methods.
  - Verifies attestation/allowlist, idempotency (`processed[eventId]`) and ordering (`lastSeq[user]`).
  - Dispatches to domain contracts and emits canonical EVM events.

- Canonical ABI: `TransactionSigned(address user, bytes32 walletId, bytes32 txHash, uint8 chainType)` across contracts/ABIs.

- Atomic 3‚Äëphase flow: Walrus provisional ‚Üí Sui pointer update ‚Üí finalize/rollback, with Sapphire emitting `AtomicUpdateCompleted`/`OperationRolledBack`.

### Technology Roles & Responsibilities

#### üîµ Sui - Public Coordination and State Layer

**Role:** Source of truth for all public, on-chain user actions and configurations. The client application writes directly to Sui for these operations.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Public State Management:** Hosts on-chain Move objects that represent the public-facing aspects of the system
- **Device Registry:** Manages a user's list of authorized devices, including their public keys and status (active, revoked). This is a public, auditable log
- **Data Pointers:** Stores public pointers (Content Identifiers, or CIDs) that reference the user's encrypted data blobs stored on Walrus
- **Source of Events:** Acts as the origin for key user actions like creating a vault or registering a new device. These Sui events are the starting point for the data mirroring pipeline
- **Recovery Logic:** Coordinates the social recovery process by managing guardian lists and recovery thresholds

#### üîê Sui zkLogin - Primary Authentication and Onboarding Mechanism

**Role:** Creates a seed-phrase-free user experience through Web2 social login integration.

**Responsibilities:**

- **User Onboarding:** Allows users to create a non-custodial Sui wallet address by authenticating with their existing Web2 accounts (e.g., Google, Apple)
- **Seedless Experience:** Eliminates the need for users to manage a seed phrase, linking account access directly to their familiar social logins
- **Account Recovery:** Serves as a foundational component of the account recovery flow, combined with social recovery shares

#### üü£ Oasis Sapphire - Confidential Compute and Private Logic Layer

**Role:** Secure TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) where all sensitive data is processed and all private operations are executed.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Enclave-Based Operations:** Hosts the core Password Vault and Wallet Vault smart contracts. All sensitive logic, like password decryption or transaction signing, happens inside its secure enclave
- **Private Key Custody & Signing:** Securely stores decryption keys for user vaults. When a user wants to sign a transaction (for EVM or Sui), the encrypted private key is loaded into the Sapphire enclave, used for signing, and then immediately purged. The key is never exposed
- **Simplified Multi-Chain Support:** Provides generic transaction signing capabilities while frontend handles chain-specific RPC calls and balance fetching for better flexibility and performance
- **Synthetic Event Emission:** Acts as the destination for the ROFL mirror. It receives translated data from Sui and emits corresponding standard EVM events (e.g., VaultCreated, DeviceRegistered, BreachAlert)
- **Data Source for Indexing:** These EVM events emitted by Sapphire are the sole data source that The Graph indexes to build its real-time data layer

Implementation notes:

- Add `MirrorInbox` contract (attestation/allowlist, idempotency, ordering; payload.version).
- `GrandWardenVault`: TEE decrypt on view paths; never emit secrets.
- `WalletVault`: generic transaction signing; frontend handles chain-specific details and RPC calls.

#### üåâ Oasis ROFL - Critical Data Bridge

**Role:** Connects the Sui and Sapphire ecosystems, enabling a unified data view across both chains.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Sui Event Mirroring:** Runs as a trusted off-chain worker that constantly listens to the Sui network for relevant events (like new vaults or device changes)
- **Cross-Chain Translation:** When a Sui event is detected, ROFL translates it into a format that the Sapphire smart contracts can understand
- **Triggering Synthetic Events:** It calls a specific function on a Sapphire smart contract (e.g., `emitSyntheticEvent()`) which then emits the corresponding EVM event for The Graph to index
- **Enabling Sui Indexing:** Its primary purpose is to solve the problem that The Graph cannot natively index Sui. By mirroring events to Sapphire, it makes Sui's activity "visible" to the EVM-centric Graph Node

#### üíæ Walrus + Seal - Decentralized Storage and Access Control Layer

**Role:** Provides secure, decentralized storage for all encrypted user data with fine-grained access control.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Walrus (Storage):** Provides decentralized, content-addressed blob storage. It is responsible for persistently storing the large, encrypted blobs containing the user's password vault and wallet keys
- **Seal (Access Control):** Acts as the gatekeeper for Walrus. It enforces the access control policies defined on Sui, ensuring that only authorized devices can fetch the encrypted data blobs

#### üìä The Graph - Real-Time Data Layer

**Role:** Provides unified, queryable access to all system events and state changes through GraphQL.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Event Indexing:** Indexes all EVM events emitted by Sapphire contracts (including synthetic events mirrored from Sui via ROFL)
- **Real-Time Subscriptions:** Enables WebSocket subscriptions for instant UI updates when events occur
- **Query Interface:** Provides a unified GraphQL endpoint for the frontend to query user activity, breach alerts, and system analytics
- **Data Aggregation:** Combines and correlates events from multiple sources into coherent user and system-level metrics

### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Setup

#### Step 1: Start the Graph Node Stack

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to docker directory
cd graph-node/docker

# Start all services (Graph Node, IPFS, PostgreSQL, Emulator)
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Services:**
| Service | Port | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|

| **Sapphire Emulator** | 8545 | ‚úÖ Running | RPC proxy with `eth_getBlockReceipts` |

#### Step 2: Verify Emulator Connectivity

```bash
# Test basic RPC connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# Test eth_getBlockReceipts (custom method)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockReceipts","params":["latest"],"id":1}'
```

### üìä Subgraph Development & Deployment

#### Step 1: Install Graph CLI

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Verify installation
graph --version
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Subgraph Project

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-grandwarden-subgraph
cd my-grandwarden-subgraph

# Initialize package.json
npm init -y

# Install dependencies
npm install @graphprotocol/graph-cli@0.69.0 @graphprotocol/graph-ts@0.31.0
```

#### Step 3: Configure Subgraph Manifest

Create `subgraph.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: GrandWardenVault
    network: oasis # This MUST match docker-compose.yml: ethereum: 'oasis:http://emulator:8545'
    source:
      address: "0xYourSapphireContractAddress"
      abi: GrandWardenVault
      startBlock: 12700000 # Use recent block number
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mapping.ts
      entities:
        - VaultCreated
        - DeviceRegistered
        - BreachAlert
        - User
      abis:
        - name: GrandWardenVault
          file: ./abis/GrandWardenVault.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: VaultCreated(indexed address,bytes32,uint256)
          handler: handleVaultCreated
        - event: DeviceRegistered(indexed address,bytes32,string)
          handler: handleDeviceRegistered
        - event: BreachAlert(indexed address,uint256,string)
          handler: handleBreachAlert
```

#### Step 4: Define GraphQL Schema

Create `schema.graphql`:

```graphql
type VaultCreated @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  vaultId: Bytes!
  timestamp: BigInt!
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}

type DeviceRegistered @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  deviceId: Bytes!
  deviceName: String!
  timestamp: BigInt!
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}

type BreachAlert @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  severity: BigInt!
  message: String!
  timestamp: BigInt!
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}

type User @entity(immutable: false) {
  id: ID! # address
  vaultsCreated: [VaultCreated!]! @derivedFrom(field: "user")
  devicesRegistered: [DeviceRegistered!]! @derivedFrom(field: "user")
  breachAlerts: [BreachAlert!]! @derivedFrom(field: "user")
  totalVaults: BigInt!
  totalDevices: BigInt!
  totalBreaches: BigInt!
  lastActivity: BigInt!
}
```

#### Step 5: Implement Event Handlers

Create `src/mapping.ts`:

```typescript
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import {
  VaultCreated as VaultCreatedEvent,
  DeviceRegistered as DeviceRegisteredEvent,
  BreachAlert as BreachAlertEvent,
} from "../generated/GrandWardenVault/GrandWardenVault";
import {
  VaultCreated,
  DeviceRegistered,
  BreachAlert,
  User,
} from "../generated/schema";

export function handleVaultCreated(event: VaultCreatedEvent): void {
  // Create or load user
  let user = User.load(event.params.user.toHexString());
  if (user == null) {
    user = new User(event.params.user.toHexString());
    user.totalVaults = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.totalDevices = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.totalBreaches = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.lastActivity = BigInt.fromI32(0);
  }
  user.totalVaults = user.totalVaults.plus(BigInt.fromI32(1));
  user.lastActivity = event.block.timestamp;
  user.save();

  // Create VaultCreated entity
  let vaultCreated = new VaultCreated(
    event.transaction.hash.toHexString() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString()
  );
  vaultCreated.user = user.id;
  vaultCreated.vaultId = event.params.vaultId;
  vaultCreated.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  vaultCreated.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  vaultCreated.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  vaultCreated.save();
}

export function handleDeviceRegistered(event: DeviceRegisteredEvent): void {
  // Create or load user
  let user = User.load(event.params.user.toHexString());
  if (user == null) {
    user = new User(event.params.user.toHexString());
    user.totalVaults = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.totalDevices = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.totalBreaches = BigInt.fromI32(0);
    user.lastActivity = BigInt.fromI32(0);

  user.save();

  // Create DeviceRegistered entity
  let deviceRegistered = new DeviceRegistered(
    event.transaction.hash.toHexString() + "-" + event.logIndex.toString()
  );
  deviceRegistered.user = user.id;
  deviceRegistered.deviceId = event.params.deviceId;
  deviceRegistered.deviceName = event.params.deviceName;
  deviceRegistered.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  deviceRegistered.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  deviceRegistered.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  breachAlert.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  breachAlert.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  breachAlert.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  breachAlert.save();
}
```

#### Step 6: Add Contract ABI

Create `abis/GrandWardenVault.json` with your contract's ABI including the events:

```json
[
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "user",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "bytes32",
        "name": "vaultId",
        "type": "bytes32"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "timestamp",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "VaultCreated",
    "type": "event"
  },
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "user",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "bytes32",
        "name": "deviceId",
        "type": "bytes32"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "deviceName",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "name": "DeviceRegistered",
    "type": "event"
  },
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "user",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "severity",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "message",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "name": "BreachAlert",
    "type": "event"
  }
]
```

#### Step 7: Build and Deploy

```bash
# Generate TypeScript types
graph codegen

# Build the subgraph
graph build

# Create subgraph on local Graph Node
graph create --node http://localhost:8020 grandwarden-vault

# Deploy to local Graph Node
graph deploy --node http://localhost:8020 --ipfs http://localhost:5001 grandwarden-vault
```

### üîç Querying Your Subgraph

#### GraphQL Endpoint

```
http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/grandwarden-vault
```

#### Example Queries

**Get recent vault creations:**

```graphql
{
  vaultCreateds(first: 10, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    user {
      id
    }
    vaultId
    timestamp
    blockNumber
  }
}
```

**Get users with most activity:**

```graphql
{
  users(first: 5, orderBy: totalVaults, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    totalVaults
    totalDevices
    totalBreaches
    lastActivity
  }
}
```

**Get recent breach alerts:**

```graphql
{
  breachAlerts(first: 10, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    user {
      id
    }
    severity
    message
    timestamp
  }
}
```

**Subscribe to real-time breach alerts:**

```graphql
subscription {
  breachAlerts(first: 1, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    user {
      id
    }
    severity
    message
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### üîß Operational Commands

#### Health Checks

```bash
# Check Graph Node status
curl http://localhost:8030/health

# Check subgraph sync status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/grandwarden-vault \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ _meta { block { number } } }"}'

# Check emulator connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

#### Monitoring & Logs

```bash
# View Graph Node logs
docker-compose logs graph-node

# View emulator logs
docker-compose logs emulator

# View all service logs
docker-compose logs

# Monitor PostgreSQL data
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U graph-node -d graph-node -c "SELECT * FROM subgraphs.subgraph;"
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Subgraph stuck at old block:**

   - Check RPC emulator logs for rate limiting
   - Verify upstream Sapphire RPC is responding
   - Consider adjusting start block to more recent

2. **No events indexed:**

   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Check that events are actually being emitted
   - Ensure ABI matches contract events exactly

3. **Build errors:**
   - Update Graph CLI to latest version
   - Check TypeScript types are correctly generated
   - Verify all imports in mapping.ts

### üìã Configuration Reference

#### Docker Compose Configuration

**Key emulator configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
emulator:
  build: ./emulator
  ports:
    - "8545:8545"
  environment:
    UPSTREAM_RPC: https://oasis-sapphire-testnet.core.chainstack.com/459accf372e882984c0af24ea5c6da20

graph-node:
  image: graphprotocol/graph-node
  environment:
    ethereum: "oasis:http://emulator:8545" # This connects Graph Node to our emulator
    postgres_host: postgres
    ipfs: "ipfs:5001"
```

#### Emulator Features

The custom Sapphire emulator (`docker/emulator/index.js`) provides:

1. **eth_getBlockReceipts emulation** - Aggregates individual transaction receipts
2. **Transparent proxy** - Forwards all other RPC calls to Sapphire
3. **Error handling** - Graceful upstream RPC failures
4. **Request logging** - Debug incoming Graph Node requests

### üéØ Integration with ROFL

When your ROFL worker mirrors Sui events to Sapphire:

1. **ROFL calls Sapphire contract** method (e.g., `emitSyntheticEvent()`)
2. **Sapphire contract emits standard EVM events** that match your subgraph schema
3. **Graph Node picks up events** via the emulator
4. **Subgraph indexes events** using your mapping handlers
5. **Frontend queries GraphQL** endpoint for real-time data

This creates a seamless bridge from Sui ‚Üí Sapphire ‚Üí Graph Node ‚Üí Your App.
